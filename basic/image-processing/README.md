# Image processing

> ***Image processing*** is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it

<br />

## Types of Image Processing

- Visualization - Find objects in the image
- Recognition - Detect objects in the image
- Sharpening and restoration - Create an enhanced image from the original image
- Pattern recognition - Measure the various patterns around the objects in the image
- Retrieval - Browse and search images from a large database of digital images that are similar to the original image

<br />

## Applications of Image Processing

- Medical Image Retrieval
- Traffic Sensing Technologies
- Image Reconstruction
- Face Detection
- Benefits of Image Processing

<br />

## Languages used in Image processing

- Python
- Matlab
- Java
- C or C++

<br />

# Install
