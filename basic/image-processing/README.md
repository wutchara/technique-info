# Image processing

> ***Image processing*** is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it

<br />

## Types of Image Processing

- Visualization - Find objects in the image
- Recognition - Detect objects in the image
- Sharpening and restoration - Create an enhanced image from the original image
- Pattern recognition - Measure the various patterns around the objects in the image
- Retrieval - Browse and search images from a large database of digital images that are similar to the original image

<br />

## Applications of Image Processing

- Medical Image Retrieval
- Traffic Sensing Technologies
- Image Reconstruction
- Face Detection
- Benefits of Image Processing

<br />

## Languages used in Image processing

- Python
- Matlab
- Java
- C or C++

<br />

# Install
```
python3 -m pip install Pillow
```

<br />

## Image processing algorithms

### Morphological Image Processing
> Morphological image processing tries to remove the imperfections from the binary images because binary regions produced by simple thresholding can be distorted by noise. It also helps in smoothing the image using opening and closing operations.

- **dilation** operation adds pixels to the boundaries of the object in an image

- **erosion** operation removes the pixels from the object boundaries. 


### Gaussian Image Processing
> Gaussian blur which is also known as gaussian smoothing, is the result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function.


### Fourier Transform
> Fourier transform breaks down an image into sine and cosine components. 

### Edge Detection
> Edge detection is an image processing technique for finding the boundaries of objects within images. It works by detecting discontinuities in brightness.

### Wavelet Image
> We saw a Fourier transform but it is only limited to the frequency. Wavelets take both time and frequency into the consideration. This transform is apt for non-stationary signals.
