# Design Patterns

A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem

## Singletons
> Make sure a 'class' can create only one time


<br />

## Observers
> An object maintains a list of dependents/observers and notifies them automatically on state changes

<br />

## Factories
> The factory pattern is a creational pattern that doesnâ€™t require us to use a constructor but provides a generic interface for creating objects.

<br />

## Dependency Injection
> Dependency injection is a software design pattern in which one or more dependencies (or services) are injected, or passed by reference, into a dependent object.

<br />

## Middlewares / pipelines
> concept: the output of one unit/function is the input for the next.

<br />

## Streams
> They are better at processing bigger amounts of flowing data, even if they are bytes, not objects.

<br />
